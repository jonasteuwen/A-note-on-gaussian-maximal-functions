abstract = {We study, in \$L\^{}\{1\}(\backslash R\^{}n;\backslash gamma)\$ with respect to the gaussian measure, non-tangential maximal functions and conical square functions associated with the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck operator by developing a set of techniques which allow us, to some extent, to compensate for the non-doubling character of the gaussian measure. The main result asserts that conical square functions can be controlled in \$L\^{}1\$-norm by non-tangential maximal functions. Along the way we prove a change of aperture result for the latter. This complements recent results on gaussian Hardy spaces due to Mauceri and Meda.},

@article{Portal2014,
abstract = {Building on the author's recent work with Jan Maas and Jan van Neerven, this paper establishes the equivalence of two norms (one using a maximal function, the other a square function) used to define a Hardy space on $\R^{n}$ with the gaussian measure, that is adapted to the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroup. In contrast to the atomic Gaussian Hardy space introduced earlier by Mauceri and Meda, the $h^{1}(\R^{n};d\gamma)$ space studied here is such that the Riesz transforms are bounded from $h^{1}(\R^{n};d\gamma)$ to $L^{1}(\R^{n};d\gamma)$. This gives a gaussian analogue of the seminal work of Fefferman and Stein in the case of the Lebesgue measure and the usual Laplacian.},
